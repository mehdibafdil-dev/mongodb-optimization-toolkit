# MongoDB Optimization Toolkit

Welcome to the MongoDB Optimization Toolkit! This project is designed to empower developers and teams to enhance the performance of their MongoDB applications. With a focus on best practices and efficient coding patterns, this toolkit provides everything you need to optimize your database interactions and ensure your applications run smoothly.

## Why This Toolkit?

In the fast-paced world of software development, performance is key. Slow database queries can lead to frustrated users and increased costs. This toolkit aims to tackle common performance pitfalls in MongoDB, providing you with the tools to build efficient, scalable applications. 

## Project Architecture

The MongoDB Optimization Toolkit is structured to facilitate easy navigation and modular development. Here’s a breakdown of the architecture:

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehdibafdil-dev/mongodb-optimization-toolkit.git
cd mongodb-optimization-toolkit
npm install
```

### Usage

To initialize the optimizer in your application, use the following code:

```javascript
const MongoDBOptimizer = require('./src/optimizers/MongoDBOptimizer');
const config = require('./config/default');

const optimizer = new MongoDBOptimizer(config.mongodb);
await optimizer.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database');
```

## Key Features

- **N+1 Query Prevention**: Optimize your queries to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Intelligent Index Management**: Automatically create and manage indexes based on usage patterns.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track query durations, memory usage, and active connections with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Safe Transactions**: Ensure data integrity with session-based transactions.
